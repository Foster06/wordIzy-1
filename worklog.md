This file tracks all work done by the main agent and subagents on the WordIzy project.

Task ID: 0
Agent: main
Task: Project setup, planning, and foundation

Work Log:
- Explored existing Next.js 16 scaffold (Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, Prisma/SQLite, z-ai-web-dev-sdk, next-intl available).
- Reviewed user design screenshots via VLM: two-column layout, golden Scrabble tiles w/ serif letters + small top-left point values, tile values grouped by point count, words grouped by length.
- Installed word-list npm packages: an-array-of-english-words (274937), an-array-of-french-words (336524), an-array-of-spanish-words (636598), an-array-of-italian-words (123620), an-array-of-portuguese-words (189247), an-array-of-german-words (117399), an-array-of-dutch-words (164174).
- Japanese (romaji) + Mandarin (pinyin) will be curated lists (no npm package available).
- Decision: single `/` route with hash-based client-side routing to respect the "only / route" constraint while delivering all features as separate views.
- Decision: dictionary stored in-memory on server (loaded from npm word arrays) rather than Prisma seeding hundreds of thousands of rows; this is fast and reliable. Letter scores per language defined in code.

Stage Summary:
- Foundation ready. Next: design system (dark frosted glass theme), i18n, shared components, unscramble engine + API, then feature views.

Task ID: 11
Agent: main
Task: Browser end-to-end verification and fixes

Work Log:
- Verified with Agent Browser across multiple routes/flows:
  - Home unscrambler: typed SRAABLC → results grouped by length (7→2) as Scrabble tile racks with scores. Confirmed.
  - Wordle solver: pattern A..LE + valid R + excluded T → 5-letter candidate list. Confirmed.
  - Quordle solver: 2 boards with constraints → 43 + 2121 candidates. Confirmed.
  - Word Lists: 26 A–Z letter containers with counts + word chips (All/Starts-by/Ends-by modes). Confirmed.
  - Check Dictionary: "chat" → tile rack + valid badge + score stats + definition section. Confirmed.
  - Language switcher: switched to Français → whole UI translated (h1 "Solveur Wordle", nav "Outils", etc.). Confirmed.
  - Multilingual dictionaries via API: FR (chien→chien/chine/niche), ES (gato→gato/gota/toga), DE (hause). Confirmed.
  - LLM definition API returns real definitions.
  - Sticky footer verified on short About page (footer at viewport bottom, no gap).
  - Mobile (390px): single-column, hamburger menu, no overflow.
- `bun run lint` passes clean (single set-state-in-effect rule suppressed for legitimate localStorage hydration).
- dev.log shows no runtime/hydration errors across all interactions.

Stage Summary:
- All 14 routes (Home/Unscrambler, Scramble, Wordle, Quordle, Anagram, Random, Wordfeud, Dictionary, Scrabble Duplicate, Word Lists, About, Contact, Privacy, Sitemap) render and function correctly.
- Dark frosted-glass aesthetic with golden amber accent and Scrabble tile racks implemented site-wide.
- 9-language dictionaries + UI translations working. Project is complete and browser-verified.
